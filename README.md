## How to use
- **MUST: Install the [Nim compiler, MinGW and add to path](https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html)**
- Since this needs a Discord Webhook (like all things do in life), go create one
- Replace the webhook link and user ID with your stuffies
- `nim c -d:ssl -d:release <filename>.nim` aaaand _win_

### TODO
- Nicer upload (using embeds)
- Testing on computers without the nim toolchain
- Make code less weird
