- Written with pure libs (no need for DLLs)
- No caching, everything done on-time
- Supports a LOT of browsers and clients

## How to use
- **MUST: Download the [Nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html), and run finish.exe**
- Download repo as zip / git clone, and store somewhere
- Since this needs a Discord Webhook (like all things do in life), go create one
- Replace the webhook link and user ID with your thingies
- Run `Compile.bat`, which will sort out everything for you
